            I have always been drawn to cold places. Perhaps it is the unique
            atmophere which is created by dark and gloomy landscapes, or perhaps
            it is the cold air I breathe, which makes me feel sharp and on the
            edge at all times.<br />
            I visited <u><strong>Iceland</strong></u> in late winter, and was
            immersed by its vast spectrum of mountains, waterfalls and natural
            formations. There is so much to see, and everything thrives by its
            uniquness and raw beauty.

            I found this <u>quote</u> quite fitting:
            <blockquote cite="https://www.thetravellingtom.com/iceland-quotes">
              “The problem with driving around Iceland is that you’re basically
              confronted by a new soul-enriching, breath-taking, life-affirming
              natural sight every five goddam minutes. It’s totally exhausting.”

            Wonderful people, buzzing biodiversity, mouth-watering cuisine.
            <u><strong>South Africa</strong></u> provides everything your heart
            wants. Theres is so much to see and do, ranging from spectacular
            hikes (such as the famous table mountain), botanical gardens and
            whale watching, to endulging in the vast spectrum of local dishes
            found in extravagant food festivals.

          <p>
            A staggering number of countries are affected by increasing
            overpopulation. When visiting such places, you can feel overwhelmed
            and drowned by the sheer incomprehesible densitive of people
            surrounging yourself, at times it can be hard to keep a clear
            head.<br />
            <u><strong>Alaska</strong></u> is not one of those place, in
            contrary, it feels like you're alone when travelling through this
            vast country with its untouched nature. Instead, you are immersed by
            it's inhabitants such as moose or bears. A pristine location, that
            makes you to think of life in a different way.

        <div class="card-content">
          <p>
            <u><strong>Norway</strong></u> has to be one of the most visually
            stunning locations with landscpaes boasting a wide range of
            spectacular characteristics. I had the pleasure to visit this place,
            and I was hoping for the right conditions to encounter the majestic,
            beautiful aurora borealis. I should not be dissapointed, we had
            clear skies for most of the trip and I was immersed by intense
            displays of colour bands, dancing and wiggling along the nihght
            skies. Surely, a spectacle I will never forget.
